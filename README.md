iCar Dealership Management System

Project Overview
iCar is a Java console-based dealership management system built using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles.  
The system allows users to view available cars, search cars, purchase cars, and generate sales reports.  

It is designed to demonstrate advanced arrays, inheritance, encapsulation, constructors, loops, and unit testing concepts taught in Java courses.
